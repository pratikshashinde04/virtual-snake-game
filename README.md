# virtual-snake-game
In this project, I have implemented a virtual snake  game. A classic game is famous for using your own success against you when you become so cocky that you get in your own way. Whilst many games and activities can teach your child about vital life skills, ARF, i.e., virtual snake game, is a tool that can be used as an educational helping hand. ARF will not only make children enthusiastic in terms of games and inculcate the competitive nature along with fun and amusement, but it will also teach a very important life lesson in a very easy way: practise makes a man perfect when it comes to learning new skills.
